# React Skeleton

This project is a skeleton setup to allow for the creation of additional projects. In order to make it work properly there are some steps that must be followed. These will be listed in the list below.

## Installation Steps

1. Download NodeJS to get npm installed - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Once NodeJS has been installed, run npm install at the root of this project.
3. Once all packages are downloaded run npm start to start webpack and run the application. Go to `localhost:3000` to view the project.
4. _(Optional)_ Install Prettier, Eslint and Flow Language support extensions on Visual Code to allow for linting and formatting.

**Disclaimer:** Optional settings are only for Visual Code, if you use another text editor, using that option requires different configuration.
